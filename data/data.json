          "context": "Mechatronics, also called mechatronics engineering, is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that focuses on the integration of mechanical, electrical and electronic engineering systems, and also includes a combination of robotics, electronics, computer science, telecommunications, systems, control, and product engineering.\nAs technology advances over time, various subfields of engineering have succeeded in both adapting and multiplying. \nThe intention of mechatronics is to produce a design solution that unifies each of these various subfields. Originally, the field of mechatronics was intended to be nothing more than a combination of mechanics, electrical and electronics, hence the name being a portmanteau of the words \"mechanics\" and \"electronics\"; however, as the complexity of technical systems continued to evolve, the definition had been broadened to include more technical areas.\nThe word mechatronics originated in Japanese-English and was created by Tetsuro Mori, an engineer of Yaskawa Electric Corporation. The word mechatronics was registered as trademark by the company in Japan with the registration number of \"46-32714\" in 1971. The company later released the right to use the word to the public, and the word began being used globally. Currently the word is translated into many languages and is considered an essential term for advanced automated industry.\nMany people treat mechatronics as a modern buzzword synonymous with automation, robotics and electromechanical engineering.\nFrench standard NF E 01-010 gives the following definition: \"approach aiming at the synergistic integration of mechanics, electronics, control theory, and computer science within product design and manufacturing, in order to improve and/or optimize its functionality\".[5]\nA mechatronics engineer unites the principles of mechanics, electrical, electronics, and computing to generate a simpler, more economical and reliable system. The term \"mechatronics\" was coined by Tetsuro Mori, the senior engineer of the Japanese company Yaskawa in 1969. An industrial robot is a prime example of a mechatronics system; it includes aspects of electronics, mechanics, and computing to do its day-to-day jobs.\nEngineering cybernetics deals with the question of control engineering of mechatronic systems. It is used to control or regulate such a system (see control theory). Through collaboration, the mechatronic modules perform the production goals and inherit flexible and agile manufacturing properties in the production scheme. Modern production equipment consists of mechatronic modules that are integrated according to a control architecture. The most known architectures involve hierarchy, polyarchy, heterarchy, and hybrid. The methods for achieving a technical effect are described by control algorithms, which might or might not utilize formal methods in their design. Hybrid systems important to mechatronics include production systems, synergy drives,\nexploration rovers, automotive subsystems such as anti-lock braking systems and spin-assist, and everyday equipment such as autofocus cameras, video, hard disks, CD players and phones.\nMechatronics students take courses in various fields:\nMechanical modeling calls for modeling and simulating physical complex phenomena in the scope of a multi-scale and multi-physical approach. This implies to implement and to manage modeling and optimization methods and tools, which are integrated in a systemic approach.\nThe specialty is aimed for students in mechanics who want to open their mind to systems engineering, and able to integrate different physics or technologies, as well as students in mechatronics who want to increase their knowledge in optimization and multidisciplinary simulation techniques.\nThe specialty educates students in robust and/or optimized conception methods for structures or many technological systems, and to the main modeling and simulation tools used in R&D. Special courses are also proposed for original applications (multi-materials composites, innovating transducers and actuators, integrated systems, �) to prepare the students to the coming breakthrough in the domains covering the materials and the systems.\nFor some mechatronic systems, the main issue is no longer how to implement a control system, but how to implement actuators. Within the mechatronic field, mainly two technologies are used to produce movement/motion.\nAn emerging variant of this field is biomechatronics, whose purpose is to integrate mechanical parts with a human being, usually in the form of removable gadgets such as an exoskeleton. This is the \"real-life\" version of cyberware.\nAnother variant is Motion control for Advanced Mechatronics, presently recognized as a key technology in mechatronics. The robustness of motion control will be represented as a function of stiffness and a basis for practical realization. Target of motion is parameterized by control stiffness which could be variable according to the task reference. The system robustness of motion always requires very high stiffness in the controller.[6]\nAvionics is also considered a variant of mechatronics as it combines several fields such as electronics and telecom with Aerospace engineering.\nMechatronic systems represent a large part of the functions of an automobile. The control loop formed by sensor -- information processing -- actuator -- mechanical (physical) change is found in many systems. The system size can be very different. The Anti-lock braking system (ABS) is a mechatronic system. The brake itself is also one. And the control loop formed by driving control (for example cruise control), engine, vehicle driving speed in the real world and speed measurement is a mechatronic system, too.[7] The great importance of mechatronics for automotive engineering is also evident from the fact that vehicle manufacturers often have development departments with \"Mechatronics\" in their names.\nThe Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data.\nIoT and mechatronics are complementary. Many of the smart components associated with the Internet of Things will be essentially mechatronic. The development of the IoT is forcing mechatronics engineers, designers, practitioners and educators to research the ways in which mechatronic systems and components are perceived, designed and manufactured. This allows them to face up to new issues such as data security, machine ethics and the human-machine interface.[8]\nAt the intersections of mechanics, electronics, and computing�mechatronics specialists create simpler, smarter systems.\nMechatronics is a multidisciplinary field that refers to the skill sets needed in the contemporary, advanced automated manufacturing industry. At the intersection of mechanics, electronics, and computing, mechatronics specialists create simpler, smarter\nsystems. Mechatronics is an essential foundation for the expected growth in automation and manufacturing.\nMechatronics deals with robotics, control systems, and electro-mechanical systems�Do you like mechanics, robotics, or production equipment? Do you have a knack for creative problem solving? Do you enjoy technical and engineering activities? Can you work well as a member of a team? Mechatronics could be for you. Request information today.\nMechatronics specialists can do quite a bit across multiple disciplines and have a solid base from which to grow. \nMechatronics specialists know both mechanical and electrical engineering fundamentals�they speak both languages�so a mechatronics specialist can work with both mechanical and engineering teams.\nMechatronics specialists work with massive industrial robots, smaller robots in pick-and-place operations, control systems for bottling or packaging of food and drink products, drones, designing control systems for rides in amusement parks, prototype development.\nSome mechatronics specialists are employed in firms where it is necessary to design and maintain automatic equipment. This includes industries such as manufacturing, mining, aviation, robotics, defense, and transport. \nOther mechatronic specialists are employed by large manufacturing companies involved in high-volume production.\nMany new career opportunities are on the horizon due to technological advances.\nA degree in mechatronics can lead to management positions, including project management.\nWorkplaces range from laboratories and processing plants to engineering design offices.\nMechatronics specialists work in the fields of cybersecurity, telecommunications, computer science, automotive engineering, robotics, artificial intelligence, and consumer products and packaging.\n\nMechatronic specialists may use the following job titles:\nMechatronic specialists have broad multidisciplinary skills, so they are able to move into more traditional engineering disciplines.\nA mechatronics specialist is a creative problem solver who can work on a team. \nThinking creatively is the first step; being able to communicate good ideas to coworkers involves tact.\nMany mechatronic engineers use computer-aided design (CAD) and other engineering software for modeling, simulating, and analyzing complex mechanical, electronic, or other engineering systems.\nThere are many tasks mechatronic specialists perform, depending on their particular industry. \nSome design, develop, maintain, and manage high-technology engineering systems for the automation of industrial tasks. \nOthers apply mechatronic/automated solutions to the transfer of material components or finished goods, or design and assist with the manufacture of consumer products such as cameras and video recorders. \nStill others carry out studies into the feasibility, cost implications, and performance benefits of new mechatronic equipment. \nAnd others apply electronic and mechanical processes and computers to tasks where the use of human labor may be dangerous (for example, underwater exploration, mining, or forestry).\nAccording to Recruiter, the mean salary for a mechatronics engineer is $88,800 with the top ten percent earning close to $103,380.\nAccording to the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of jobs for Mechatronics Specialists is expected to experience moderate growth, specifically in Michigan and Wisconsin. \nMichigan Tech is strategically located in close proximity to the largest automotive companies that have expressed they are in need of Mechatronics professionals.\nTechnical degree programs have changed. \nTraditional degrees leading directly to closely aligned positions in industry are a thing of the past. \nTomorrow needs individuals with advanced technical competencies capable of engaging in interdisciplinary research and industry applications.\nGraduates of Michigan Tech's Bachelor's in Mechatronics are key to the digital transformation of our regional and national economy. \nWhat sets this degree program apart is the way it brings together engineering and computing to create something entirely new.

The essence of it is that the design of the mechanical system must be performed together with the design of the electrical/electronic and computer control aspects that together, comprise a complete system.\nSome examples of mechatronic systems include: a CD or DVD player; a computer hard disc drive; a fly-by-wire aircraft control system; and an anti-lock braking system (ABS). Each of these products is essentially mechanical in nature, but could not function without the integral design of the electrical and computer control systems that are critical to their operation.\nThe mechatronics program at the University of Waterloo is administered by the department of mechanical and mechatronics�engineering. The courses taken in the mechatronics program differ�significantly from those taken in the mechanical engineering program.\nHalf of the second and third-year courses in mechatronics�are provided by the systems design engineering and electrical and computer engineering departments.

A group of professors from Mechanical Engineering, Systems Design Engineering, and Electrical & Computer Engineering�set out to design the 'ideal' Mechatronics curriculum in 2000.�With a virtual clean slate, a set of courses was selected from the three engineering departments that would provide students with the desired combination of skills.\nWhenever the contents of an existing course did not meet the desired requirements, a new course was designed. After much effort, we now feel that we have a program that is unmatched in terms of content and integration. When viewing the curriculum, the courses designated as MTE are the newly designed courses specific to the Mechatronics program; ME courses are from the Mechanical Engineering program, ECE courses are from the Electrical & Computer Engineering program, and SYDE courses are from the Systems Design Engineering program.\nUniversity of Waterloo graduates�often pursue careers in product and software design, technology analysis, program coordination, and more. They usually work for technology companies, manufacturers, and telecommunications companies.\nSee where some of our outstanding MME alumni are now, as shown below.\n\nThe University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. \nOur active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Office of Indigenous Relations.\nIt is my pleasure to welcome all to the website of the Department of Mechatronics Engineering in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET). \nIn Bangladesh, RUET is the first public university to introduce Mechatronics Engineering in the year of 2013.
