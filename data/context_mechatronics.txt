Mechatronics, also called mechatronics engineering, is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that focuses on the 
integration of mechanical, electrical and electronic engineering systems, and also includes a combination of robotics, 
electronics, computer science, telecommunications, systems, control, and product engineering. 
Many people treat mechatronics as a modern buzzword synonymous with automation, robotics and electromechanical engineering.
The intention of mechatronics is to produce a design solution that unifies each of these various subfields. 
Originally, the field of mechatronics was intended to be nothing more than a combination of mechanics, electrical and electronics, 
hence the name being a portmanteau of the words "mechanics" and "electronics"; however, as the complexity of technical 
systems continued to evolve, the definition had been broadened to include more technical areas. 
The word mechatronics originated in Japanese-English and was created by Tetsuro Mori, an engineer of Yaskawa Electric Corporation. 
The word mechatronics was registered as trademark by the company in Japan with the registration number of "46-32714" in 1971. 
An industrial robot is a prime example of a mechatronics system; it includes aspects of electronics, mechanics, 
and computing to do its day-to-day jobs.
