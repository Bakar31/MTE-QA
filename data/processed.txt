Mechatronics, also called mechatronics engineering, is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that focuses on the integration of mechanical, 
electrical and electronic engineering systems, and also includes a combination of robotics, electronics, computer science, telecommunications, 
systems, control, and product engineering.

As technology advances over time, various subfields of engineering have succeeded in both adapting and multiplying. 
The intention of mechatronics is to produce a design solution that unifies each of these various subfields. Originally, 
the field of mechatronics was intended to be nothing more than a combination of mechanics, electrical and electronics, 
hence the name being a portmanteau of the words "mechanics" and "electronics"; however, as the complexity of technical systems continued to evolve, 
the definition had been broadened to include more technical areas.

The word mechatronics originated in Japanese-English and was created by Tetsuro Mori, an engineer of Yaskawa Electric Corporation. 
The word mechatronics was registered as trademark by the company in Japan with the registration number of "46-32714" in 1971. 
The company later released the right to use the word to the public, and the word began being used globally. 
Currently the word is translated into many languages and is considered an essential term for advanced automated industry.
Many people treat mechatronics as a modern buzzword synonymous with automation, robotics and electromechanical engineering.

French standard NF E 01-010 gives the following definition: "approach aiming at the synergistic integration of mechanics, electronics, control theory, 
and computer science within product design and manufacturing, in order to improve and/or optimize its functionality".

A mechatronics engineer unites the principles of mechanics, electrical, electronics, and computing to generate a simpler, 
more economical and reliable system. 

The term "mechatronics" was coined by Tetsuro Mori, the senior engineer of the Japanese company Yaskawa in 1969. 

An industrial robot is a prime example of a mechatronics system; it includes aspects of electronics, mechanics, and computing to do its day-to-day jobs.

Engineering cybernetics deals with the question of control engineering of mechatronic systems. 
It is used to control or regulate such a system (see control theory). 
Through collaboration, the mechatronic modules perform the production goals and inherit flexible and agile manufacturing properties in the production scheme. 
Modern production equipment consists of mechatronic modules that are integrated according to a control architecture. The most known architectures involve hierarchy, polyarchy, heterarchy, and hybrid. The methods for achieving a technical effect are described by control algorithms, which might or might not utilize formal methods in their design. Hybrid systems important to mechatronics include production systems, synergy drives,
exploration rovers, automotive subsystems such as anti-lock braking systems and spin-assist, and everyday equipment such as autofocus cameras, video, hard disks, CD players and phones.
Mechatronics students take courses in various fields:
Mechanical modeling calls for modeling and simulating physical complex phenomena in the scope of a multi-scale and multi-physical approach. This implies to implement and to manage modeling and optimization methods and tools, which are integrated in a systemic approach.
The specialty is aimed for students in mechanics who want to open their mind to systems engineering, and able to integrate different physics or technologies, as well as students in mechatronics who want to increase their knowledge in optimization and multidisciplinary simulation techniques.
The specialty educates students in robust and/or optimized conception methods for structures or many technological systems, and to the main modeling and simulation tools used in R&D. Special courses are also proposed for original applications (multi-materials composites, innovating transducers and actuators, integrated systems, �) to prepare the students to the coming breakthrough in the domains covering the materials and the systems.
For some mechatronic systems, the main issue is no longer how to implement a control system, but how to implement actuators. Within the mechatronic field, mainly two technologies are used to produce movement/motion.
An emerging variant of this field is biomechatronics, whose purpose is to integrate mechanical parts with a human being, usually in the form of removable gadgets such as an exoskeleton. This is the "real-life" version of cyberware.
Another variant is Motion control for Advanced Mechatronics, presently recognized as a key technology in mechatronics. The robustness of motion control will be represented as a function of stiffness and a basis for practical realization. Target of motion is parameterized by control stiffness which could be variable according to the task reference. The system robustness of motion always requires very high stiffness in the controller.[6]
Avionics is also considered a variant of mechatronics as it combines several fields such as electronics and telecom with Aerospace engineering.
Mechatronic systems represent a large part of the functions of an automobile. The control loop formed by sensor -- information processing -- actuator -- mechanical (physical) change is found in many systems. The system size can be very different. The Anti-lock braking system (ABS) is a mechatronic system. The brake itself is also one. And the control loop formed by driving control (for example cruise control), engine, vehicle driving speed in the real world and speed measurement is a mechatronic system, too.[7] The great importance of mechatronics for automotive engineering is also evident from the fact that vehicle manufacturers often have development departments with "Mechatronics" in their names.
The Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data.
IoT and mechatronics are complementary. Many of the smart components associated with the Internet of Things will be essentially mechatronic. The development of the IoT is forcing mechatronics engineers, designers, practitioners and educators to research the ways in which mechatronic systems and components are perceived, designed and manufactured. This allows them to face up to new issues such as data security, machine ethics and the human-machine interface.[8]

Mechatronics engineering is the design of computer-controlled electromechanical systems. 
The essence of it is that the design of the mechanical system must be performed together with the design of the electrical/electronic 
and computer control aspects that together, comprise a complete system.

Some examples of mechatronic systems include: a CD or DVD player; a computer hard disc drive; a fly-by-wire aircraft control system; and an anti-lock braking system (ABS). Each of these products is essentially mechanical in nature, but could not function without the integral design of the electrical and computer control systems that are critical to their operation.
The mechatronics program at the University of Waterloo is administered by the department of mechanical and mechatronics�engineering. The courses taken in the mechatronics program differ�significantly from those taken in the mechanical engineering program.
Half of the second and third-year courses in mechatronics�are provided by the systems design engineering and electrical and computer engineering departments. This makes the mechatronics program�ideal for�students seeking a broad, interdisciplinary engineering education that is�highly integrated and focussed.
Today, the University of Waterloo's mechatronics program is unmatched in terms of content and integration, making it a highly sought-after program for today's students. Admission to the program is highly competitive.
Students are required to participate in the work/study (co-op) program, which entails completing five work terms in industry. The degree, a Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in Mechatronics Engineering, is accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB).

Mechatronics engineers today are changing the world by:
Mechatronics engineers use a multidisciplinary and systems-based approach to develop the �intelligent� electromechanical devices and integrated systems present in our daily lives � including: smartphones, 3D printers, satellite systems, intelligent vehicle systems, wearable devices.
Design and implementation of robotic control systems
Design and creation of wearable devices
Development of next-generation additive manufacturing (3D Printing) systems
Design and development of electric, hybrid, and autonomous vehicles.

The opportunity to design a new engineering program does not come often. A group of professors from Mechanical Engineering, Systems Design Engineering, and Electrical & Computer Engineering�set out to design the 'ideal' Mechatronics curriculum in 2000.�With a virtual clean slate, a set of courses was selected from the three engineering departments that would provide students with the desired combination of skills.
Whenever the contents of an existing course did not meet the desired requirements, a new course was designed. After much effort, we now feel that we have a program that is unmatched in terms of content and integration. When viewing the curriculum, the courses designated as MTE are the newly designed courses specific to the Mechatronics program; ME courses are from the Mechanical Engineering program, ECE courses are from the Electrical & Computer Engineering program, and SYDE courses are from the Systems Design Engineering program.
University of Waterloo graduates�often pursue careers in product and software design, technology analysis, program coordination, and more. They usually work for technology companies, manufacturers, and telecommunications companies.
