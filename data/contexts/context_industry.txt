Mechatronics is an essential foundation for the expected growth in automation and manufacturing.
Modern production equipment consists of mechatronic modules that are integrated according to a control architecture.
Mechatronic systems represent a large part of the functions of an automobile. 
The control loop formed by sensor information processing, actuator, mechanical (physical) change is found in many systems. 
One of the top reasons to get a mechatronics degree is the strong technical foundation you will gain in robotics. 
Robotics is used in the medical and healthcare fields, for the military, or in advanced manufacturing.
In these positions you'll build robotic solutions that improve manufacturing quality, quantity and productivity; 
you'll manage, execute and troubleshoot electrical, robotic and automation equipment; and you'll ensure that all robotic equipment is compliant with industry standards.
The average salary for a robotics technician, according to recruiter.com, is $51,600 per year.
