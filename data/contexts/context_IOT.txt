The Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, 
and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data.
IoT and mechatronics are complementary. Many of the smart components associated with the Internet of Things will 
be essentially mechatronic. The development of the IoT is forcing mechatronics engineers, designers, practitioners and educators 
to research the ways in which mechatronic systems and components are perceived, designed and manufactured. 
This allows them to face up to new issues such as data security, machine ethics and the human-machine interface.
At the intersections of mechanics, electronics, and computing. mechatronics specialists create simpler, smarter systems.
