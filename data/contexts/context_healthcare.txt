An emerging variant of this field is biomechatronics, whose purpose is to integrate mechanical parts with a human being, 
usually in the form of removable gadgets such as an exoskeleton. This is the "real-life" version of cyberware.
A mechatronics engineering degree can prepare you for careers designing and building bio-inspired
machines and medical devices that mimic the behaviors of humans, animals and plants (this is called bio-mimetics). 
You also may use knowledge of mechatronics engineering technology to improve clinical equipment, surgical procedures, rehabilitation strategies, micro-implants, prosthesesand more.
According to salary.com, biomedical engineering technicians earn an average of $62,282 per year.
