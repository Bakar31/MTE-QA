The word mechatronics was registered as trademark by the company in Japan with the registration number of \"46-32714\" in 1971. An industrial robot is a prime example of a mechatronics system; it includes aspects of electronics, mechanics, and computing to do its day-to-day jobs. Mechatronics systems include production systems, synergy drives,exploration rovers, automotive subsystems such as anti-lock braking systems and spin-assist, and everyday equipment such as autofocus cameras, video, hard disks, CD players and phones. The Anti-lock braking system (ABS) is a mechatronic system.And the control loop formed by driving control (for example cruise control), engine, vehicle driving speed in the real world and speed measurement is a mechatronic system, too. A mechatronics engineer unites the principles of mechanics, electrical, electronics, and computing to generate a simpler, more economical and reliable system.

      "Mechatronic systems represent a large part of the functions of an automobile. The control loop formed by sensor information processing, actuator, mechanical (physical) change is found in many systems. One of the top reasons to get a mechatronics degree is the strong technical foundation you will gain in robotics. Robotics is used in the medical and healthcare fields, for the military, or in advanced manufacturing.In these positions you'll build robotic solutions that improve manufacturing quality, quantity and productivity; you'll manage, execute and troubleshoot electrical, robotic and automation equipment; and you'll ensure that all robotic equipment is compliant with industry standards.The average salary for a robotics technician, according to recruiter.com, is $51,600 per year.The Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data.IoT and mechatronics are complementary. Many of the smart components associated with the Internet of Things will be essentially mechatronic. The development of the IoT is forcing mechatronics engineers, designers, practitioners and educators to research the ways in which mechatronic systems and components are perceived, designed and manufactured. 0.6204010248184204\n",
